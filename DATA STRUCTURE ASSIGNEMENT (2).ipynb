    "# Q1. Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a  regular Python list?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans>>\n",
    "# Using a deque from the collections module to implement a queue offers several advantages over using a regular Python list:\n",
    "# 1.Efficient Operations: Deques (double-ended queues) are optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends of the queue.\n",
    "# 2.Constant Time Complexity: Operations such as appending or popping from the beginning or end of a deque have O(1) time complexity,\n",
    "# meaning they execute in constant time regardless of the size of the deque\n",
    "#3.Memory Efficiency: Deques are implemented as doubly-linked lists under the hood, which allows them to efficiently manage memory for large queues.\n",
    "#4.Thread Safety: Deques provide atomic operations for adding and removing elements from both ends, making them suitable or concurrent programming.\n",
    "#5.Additional Features: Deques offer additional methods such as rotate() for rotating the deque in either direction and extend()\n",
    "#  for efficiently extending the deque with multiple elements. \n"

    "# is the management of function calls in programming languages.\n",
    "#1.Function Calls: Each time a function is called, a new frame (or activation record) is created and pushed onto the call stack.\n",
    "#2.Nested Function Calls: If a function calls another function, the frame for the called function is pushed onto the stack on top of the caller's frame\n",
    "# This continues for each nested function call, creating a stack of frames representing the current execution context.\n",
    "#3.Return Values: When a function completes execution, its frame is popped off the stack, and control returns to the point in the code where the \n",
    "# called from. If the function has a return value, it is typically passed back to the caller.\n",

    "#1.Memory Efficiency: Arrays in Python are more memory-efficient than lists, especially when storing large amounts of numerical data of the same type,\n",

    "# Q5.. In Python, what's the primary difference between dictionaries and lists, and how does this difference  impact their use cases in programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANS.The primary difference between dictionaries and lists in Python lies in their underlying data structures and the way they organize and access\n",
    "# data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Data Structure:\n",
    "#> List: Lists in Python are ordered collections of elements that are indexed by integers. Elements in a list are stored in a sequence and can be\n",
    "# accessed using integer indices.\n",
    "#>>Dictionary: Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each element in a dictionary consists of a key and its \n",
    "# corresponding value. Keys are used to access values, and dictionaries do not maintain any particular order among their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Access Pattern:\n",
    "#> List: Elements in a list are accessed by their integer indices, allowing for positional access. Lists are suitable for scenarios where the order\n",
    "# of elements is important, and you need to access elements based on their position in the sequence.\n",
    "#>>Dictionary: Elements in a dictionary are accessed by their keys rather than their positions. Dictionaries provide fast access to values based on\n",

    "#3.Use Cases:\n",
    "#>Lists: Lists are commonly used for storing ordered collections of elements where positional access is required. \n",

    "#4.Performance Considerations:\n",
    "#>Lists: Lists provide fast access to elements based on their integer indices. However, accessing elements by value may require iterating over\n",

    "#>> Dictionaries: Dictionaries offer constant-time access to elements based on their keys, making them highly efficient for retrieval  and update\n",
